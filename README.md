-PROJECT OVERVIEW-
* In this project, I used React to create a client for my existing school database REST API *(https://github.com/BellaBradbury/Build-a-REST-API-with-Express-WD-12.git)*. 
* My full-stack application provides a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses. Users can:
    * Interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses
    * View details for a specific course 
    * Create, update, and delete courses
* This project requires users to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database. 
* I used JavaScript and JSX to build out the components for my application in a modular fashion.
* I used React Router to set up your routes.
* I used Axios to fetch data from my REST API *(link above)*.
* My program allows users to sign up and uses basic authentication to support users signing in.
* I've added to the supplied CSS to personalize my project.
